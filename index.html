				<h2>Description</h2>
				Whatever happened to hackathons that were about getting together with friends and 
				building cool stuff?<br />
				<br />
				The idea behind the <strong>Seattle Wearables Hackathon</strong> is simple: Get 
				together with fellow hackers, build some wearable technology, and have fun! 
				Projects can be hardware hacks, mobile apps that take advantage of the fact that 
				we carry our phones on our bodies all day, or anything else you can dream up.<br />
				<br />
				You won't be required to come up with a business model or get customers (though 
				you're welcome to do so if you'd like). Instead of having a panel of judges 
				selecting 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, we'll just have some awesome sponsors handing 
				out sweet prizes for the projects of their choosing.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>IMPORTANT: Don't sign up for this event if you aren't sure you'll be able 
				to attend.</strong> Doing so is just rude and we'll be taking attendance. If you 
				register but don't show, you'll be banned from future events.<br />

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<strong>Q: What electronics will be provided for me?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> A limited supply of electronics will be available 
				to borrow during the event (see the <a href='#gadgets'>gadgets</a> 
				section). Since these will be provided on a first-come-first-served 
				basis, it is strongly recommended that you also bring your own gadgets, 
				electronics, and materials to ensure you'll be able to work on whatever 
				project you have in mind.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: Can I bring my own electronics and materials?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes. As long as you don't bring anything that 
				would endanger or pose a risk to the health of your or others, you are 
				encouraged to bring your own gadgets, electronics, and materials. 
				For on-demand 3D printers and laser cutting, there are a few maker 
				spaces within a 15-minute drive of the venue.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: I'm a business person. Can I participate?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes! We want to have a diverse crowd with a broad 
				mix of skills. However, we also want to encourage creation, so we're 
				limiting the number of tickets that are available to non-hackers.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: Can I work on a business plan?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes! We aren't being prescriptive about what you 
				can and can't do at this event. You're welcome to work on creating a 
				business around whatever tech you work on.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: What happens if I register and don't attend?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Because we've put a lot of work into getting this 
				event together and sponsors have helped us make it free to attend, we 
				will be very strict about attendance. Don't register just to hold a 
				spot for yourself. We'll be checking attendees in at the event and 
				if you don't show up, you'll be banned from participating in future 
				hackathon events (not just wearables hackathons).<br />
