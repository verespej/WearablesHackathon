				<h2>Description</h2>
				Whatever happened to hackathons that were about getting together with friends and 
				building cool stuff?<br />
				<br />
				The idea behind the <strong>Seattle Wearables Hackathon</strong> is simple: Get 
				together with fellow hackers, build some wearable technology, and have fun! 
				Projects can be hardware hacks, mobile apps that take advantage of the fact that 
				we carry our phones on our bodies all day, or anything else you can dream up.<br />
				<br />
				You won't be required to come up with a business model or get customers (though 
				you're welcome to do so if you'd like). Instead of having a panel of judges 
				selecting 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, we'll just have some awesome sponsors handing 
				out sweet prizes for the projects of their choosing.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>IMPORTANT: Don't sign up for this event if you aren't sure you'll be able 
				to attend.</strong> Doing so is just rude and we'll be taking attendance. If you 
				register but don't show, you'll be banned from future events.<br />

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<strong>Q: What electronics will be provided for me?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> A limited supply of electronics will be available 
				to borrow during the event, but these will be generic components, so 
				it is strongly recommended that you bring whatever you need for your 
				project. Be sure to think about what you'll need in advance of the 
				event and order the components and parts so you won't be blocked by 
				lack of supplies.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: Can I bring my own electronics and materials?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes. In fact, you will need to bring your own 
				supplies as we will only have minimal electronics available. If your 
				project will require 3D printing, crafting, etc. make sure to bring 
				whatever you'll need to hack it together. For on-demand 3D printers 
				and laser cutting, there are a few maker spaces within a 15 minutes 
				drive from the venue.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: I'm a business person. Can I participate?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes! We really want to have a diverse crowd with 
				a mix of skills. However, we really want to encourage creation, so 
				we're limiting the number of tickets that are available to 
				non-hackers.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: Can I work on a business plan?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes! We aren't being prescriptive about what you 
				can and can't do at this event. You're welcome to work on creating a 
				business around whatever tech you work on.<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Q: What happens if I register and don't attend?</strong><br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Because we've put a lot of work into getting this 
				event together and sponsors have helped us make it free to attend, we 
				will be very strict about attendance. Do not register just to hold a 
				spot for yourself. We will be checking attendees in at the event and 
				if you don't show up, you will be banned from participating in future 
				hackathon events (not just wearables hackathons).<br />
